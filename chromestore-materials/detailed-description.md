Oh Swift, I knew you were trouble when Craig Federighi walked in and announced you.

Searching for code samples, tutorials, and documentation is so much harder now than it was with Objective-C. Yes, there is less content on Swift than Objective-C, but Swift is also a much more common term on the web. The Untaylored Search plugin helps cut down on irrelevant search results by automatically appending negative search terms to your query.

Start a search with 'swift' (lowercase) and you'll have the option to search with this plugin. Your query will have several commonly misleading search terms appended to it automatically.

I respect your privacy and am not collecting any search term statistics or analytics.

The following negative search terms are added to your query automatically:

* Taylor Swift
* Financial
* Swift Trans
* car club
* Cycling
* Dzire
* Pokemon
* Bird
* Maruti
* Mourillon-Swift
* Orin Swift
* Wine Club
* Swiftwater Cellars
* Jonathan Swift
* Rotary Club
* Suzuki
